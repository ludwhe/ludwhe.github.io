I'm a Computer Science student from France, currently preparing a French MEng.
equivalent. My interests include Linux, free and open-source software, cloud
computing, operating systems and web development.

I'm available part-time for software development projects as freelance. If
you are interested, please contact me through [Malt](https://malt.fr/profile/louisheili).
